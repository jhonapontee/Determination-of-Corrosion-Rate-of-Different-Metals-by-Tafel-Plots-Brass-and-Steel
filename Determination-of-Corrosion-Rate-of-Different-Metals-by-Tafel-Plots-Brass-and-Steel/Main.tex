\begin{abstract}
This study investigates the electrochemical corrosion behavior of admiralty brass and steel electrodes through potentiodynamic polarization measurements and Tafel plot analysis in 0.5 M hydrochloric acid medium. The corrosion kinetics were evaluated using a three-electrode electrochemical cell configuration with titanium as counter electrode and Ag/AgCl (3 M KCl) as reference electrode. 

Open circuit potential measurements revealed initial values of \(-142.9 \, \text{mV}\) for brass and \(-441 \, \text{mV}\) for steel. Linear sweep voltammetry was conducted at a scan rate of \(1 \, \text{mV/s}\) within \(\pm 200 \, \text{mV}\) around the open circuit potential to construct Tafel plots and determine corrosion parameters through linear extrapolation methods. 

The brass electrode exhibited a corrosion current density of \(5.40 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{A/cm}^2\) and a corrosion potential of \(-0.258 \, \text{V}\), resulting in a corrosion penetration rate (CPR) of \(4.17 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{mm/year}\). The steel electrode showed a corrosion current density of \(8.87 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{A/cm}^2\) and a corrosion potential of \(-0.388 \, \text{V}\), yielding a CPR of \(8.23 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{mm/year}\). 

The anodic and cathodic Tafel slopes were determined through linear regression analysis of the polarization curves.
